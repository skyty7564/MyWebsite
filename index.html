			<p> 
				Hello to all, My Name is Bao Nguyen <br><br>
			
				I am Vietnamese, first generation of my family. For the most part I am introvert and prefer to stay out of the spot light.  
				I am aiming for my bachelor’s degree in information science. My family move to the United State in 2003, leaving behind our old life. 
				It been a long journey but my family. I am now a citizen of this country. I do prefer living in America, but from time to time, the idea of moving back to Vietnam does pop up.

				I have a Sister, and the oldest of the two. Most people who try to say my name get it wrong. Go ahead and try to pronoun my name. 
				I bet two out of three of you will get it wrong. I am Scorpio, and Ox in based on the Chinese calendar. I have a fear of doll, so if you have one in your house, and I visits.
				Let me know just in case it come alive and come after me. Same with height, can’t stand it, but if it roller coaster bring it on. You could say I am an adrenaline junkie. 
			</p>
		<h2 class="green-h2"> Hobbies </h2>
			<p>
				While I have some downtime, I like to build model kit. They are usually mech in design such as gundam, or in general gaint robot.
				Building model kit can be fun but so is collecting. I collect trading card, mostly yu-gi-oh card, Pokémon and recently vanguard and magic the gathering.
				It can be an expensive hobbies, but from building to collecting, it brings a nice slow pace back into my life.	
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Beside from that, I am very interest in art. When I mean art, not just the classic, but from street art to custom user art to all sort. It just amazing the picture or images people can come up with.
				It also provide me how people view of art change over times.In addition is just fun imagining living in some of this image, and the world or the rather possible universe out there. Furthermore, aside from art, Mythology peek 
				my curiosity.  In tandem with art, Mythology from all over the world really reveal a lot about humanity. It a very interest notion to follow for these creature show us what humanity fear, value, or even hope for in life.
